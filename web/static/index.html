        <p>Android SMS Gateway turns your Android smartphone into an SMS gateway. It's a lightweight application
            allowing you to send SMS messages programmatically via API. This makes it ideal for integrating SMS
            functionality into your own applications or services.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Send SMS programmatically: Use our API to send messages directly from your own applications or services.
            </li>
            <li>Supports Android 5.0 and above: The application is compatible with Android 5.0 and later versions.</li>
            <li>Message status tracking: Monitor the status of your sent messages in real-time.</li>
            <li>Starts at boot: The application starts running as soon as your device boots up.</li>
            <li>Prevents sleep mode: Your device won't go to sleep while the application is running, ensuring continuous
                service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ideal For</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Notifications</li>
            <li>Alerts</li>
            <li>Two-factor authentication codes</li>
        </ul>
