# Pricing

Using the Android SMS Gateway comes with different pricing based on the server you choose to use:

- **Local Server**: Utilizing the local server to send messages is always free, with no restrictions or limits.

- **Cloud Server**: Using the cloud server to send your messages may be subject to certain limits. If you are planning to send more than 1000 messages per month using the cloud server, we recommend reaching out to us for more information and possible arrangements.
